    prompt = <<~PROMPT
      You are a financial education expert creating a challenge for a game.
      The challenge is for a level named: "#{@level.name}"
      (Level description for context: "#{@level.description}")

      Please generate a single financial challenge based on this level.
      You MUST return a single, valid JSON object and nothing else.
      The JSON object must have EXACTLY the following keys:
      - "title": A short, engaging title for the challenge.
      - "category": A single-word category (e.g., "Budgeting", "Investing", "Debt", "Savings").
      - "difficulty": Use the provided Difficulty value (#{difficulty}) instead of choosing your own. Higher difficulty must reflect more complex scenarios, trickier trade-offs, or nuanced financial concepts. Base the complexity on the provided Difficulty value: 1 = introductory, 2 = intermediate, 3 = advanced.
      - "challenge_prompt": The main question or scenario. This prompt MUST include four numbered answer options (e.g., "1. Do this \n 2. Do that...").
      - "description": A short paragraph providing more story or context (can be an empty string if not needed).
      - "correct_answer": The integer number (1, 2, 3, or 4) corresponding to the correct answer option in the challenge_prompt.
      - "balance_impact": A positive integer (in Euros) representing the financial consequence of a *correct* choice. This value MUST be within the range corresponding to the 'difficulty' integer:
          - difficulty == 1: 500 - 1000
          - difficulty == 2: 1000 - 1500
          - difficulty == 3: 1500 - 2000
      - "feedback": A detailed explanation of why the correct choice is the best answer and why the others are incorrect.

      Example of a valid "challenge_prompt" format:
      "What is the best way to start building an emergency fund?
      1. Invest all your money in cryptocurrency.
      2. Open a dedicated high-yield savings account.
      3. Buy a new luxury car on finance.
      4. Pay off all student debt before saving anything."

      Example of a valid "choice" for the above prompt: 2
