  # Challenges routes
  # Decision rationale:
  
  # - :index (GET /challenges) - NOT INCLUDED: Challenges are displayed via pages#gameboard, not a standalone challenges index.
  #   The challenges#index method exists but is unused; list view is handled by the gameboard page.
  # - :new (GET /challenges/new) - NOT INCLUDED: Challenge creation is automated via AI in create action, no manual form needed.
  #   The create action renders :new on error but this is defensive coding, not core functionality.

    # Member route for updating user's choice on an existing challenge (used by gameboard form submission)
